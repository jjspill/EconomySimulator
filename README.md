# EconomySimulator
This project models the complex financial dynamics among banks, businesses, and individuals in a scaled-down economy. Motivated by the real-world crash of Silicon Valley Bank, the model simulates behaviors based on interest rates, spending, and lending, and explores possible outcomes over a 10-year span.
